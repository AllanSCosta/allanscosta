## Hi There ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student at the [Center for Bits and Atoms](https://cba.mit.edu), [Molecular Machines](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/molecular-machines/overview/), focused on machine learning for structural biology. I am interested in the intersection of physics, chemistry, biology and computer science. Learn more [here](https://allanscosta.github.io/).
